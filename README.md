Back to the basics of Java 

Variables and data types 
Declaration - the process of defining a variable, function, or object, specifying its type and name.  String namePerson; 

Initialization is assigning an initial value to a variable at the time of its declaration or before it is used in the program. This ensures that the variable holds a valid value and can be used safely in operations. 
int age ; Declaration 
age = 29 ; initialization 

Variable - a space container that holds data value (namePerson is the space holder)
Datatype - specify the different sizes and values that can be stored in a variable
Two types of data types 
1. Primitive

byte: 8-bit integer
short: 16-bit integer
int: 32-bit integer
long: 64-bit integer
float: 32-bit floating point
double: 64-bit floating point
char: 16-bit Unicode character
boolean: true or false value
 
2. Non-primitive - Reference data type 

Classes: e.g., String, Scanner
Interfaces
Arrays
 
 The semicolon (;) is used to terminate statements. It tells the Java compiler where one statement ends and the next begins.

String namePerson  = " Keo ";
